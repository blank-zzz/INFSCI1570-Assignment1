                        The leafy sea dragon (<em>Phycodurus eques</em>), also known as Glauert's seadragon, is the only member of its genus <em>Phycodurus</em> within the family <em>Syngnathidae</em>, which also includes other sea dragons, seahorses, and pipefish.
                        Leafy sea dragons grow larger than most seahorses, reaching lengths of about 20-24 cm (8-9.5 in).
                        Their elaborate leaf-like appendages allow them to blend in perfectly with drifting seaweed and kelp, making them masters of camouflage.
                        They can also change their coloration to a limited degree, although this ability depends heavily on their diet, age, and surrounding environment.

                        Leafy sea dragons are found only in the temperate coastal waters of southern and western Australia, where they inhabit kelp forests and seagrass meadows.
                        Like their seahorse relatives, the males take on the role of caring for the eggs.
                        After females deposit eggs onto the underside of the male's tail, he carries and protects them until they hatch, usually after about a month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite their delicate appearance, leafy sea dragons are strong swimmers and feed mainly on small crustaceans such as mysid shrimp, which they suck up through their long, narrow snouts.
                        Unfortunately, because of their specialized habitat and limited range they are now considered a near-threatened species and are protected under Australian law.
