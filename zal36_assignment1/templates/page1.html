                        The giant moray (<em>Gymnothorax javanicus</em>) is a species of moray eel in the family Muraenidae.
                        In terms of body mass, it is the largest moray eel, although it is not the longest as the slender giant moray (<em>Strophidon sathete</em>) beats it out.
                        Giant morays can reach lengths of up to 3 meters (10 feet) and weigh as much as 30 kilograms (66 pounds).
                        Their appearance changes over their lifetime with juveniles being tan with black spots, while adults develop smaller spots in a leopard-like pattern.

                        They are found throughout the Indo-Pacific, from East Africa to the Central Pacific, inhabiting coral reefs and lagoons.
                        Giant morays are mostly nocturnal, resting during the day and hunting at night.
                        They are believed to rely more on their sense of smell than vision when locating prey.
                    </p>

                        Fun Fact: Giant morays have been observed engaging in cooperative hunting with the roving coral grouper.
                        The moray searches the reef's crevices, flushing out hidden fish, while the grouper catches those that flee into open water.
                        At the same time, the grouper's presence drives some prey back into the reef, where the moray lies in ambush.
                        This kind of cospecies coordinated hunting is rare in the animal kingdom, one of the few examples of interspecies cooperation.
